# Foundations of Data Science

Learn how data professionals operate in the workplace and how different roles in the field of data science contribute to an organization’s vision of the future. Then, explore data science roles, communication skills, and data ethics.

## Each course offers many types of learning opportunities:

Self-review activities and labs give you hands-on practice in applying the skills you are learning and allow you to assess your own work by comparing it to a completed example.

Interactive plug-ins encourage you to practice specific tasks and help you integrate the knowledge you have gained in the course.

In-video quizzes help you check your comprehension as you progress through each video.

Practice quizzes allow you to check your understanding of key concepts and provide valuable feedback.

Graded quizzes demonstrate your understanding of the main concepts of a course. You must score 80% or higher on each graded quiz to obtain a certificate, and you can take a graded quiz multiple times to achieve a passing score.
